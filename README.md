# Agreement-Summarizer

## 💡 Inspiration
A genuine problem faced by millions of people every day. There was not enough awareness and useful tools for navigating the confusing terrain of online agreements. Big tech companies often collect and store large amounts of user data, which users consent to unknowingly. 

## 📃 What it does 
Condenses thousands of lines in agreement forms into the few concise lines containing key points. Customizes the points according to the user's preferences and suggests alternative services that may provide more user-friendly policies. We have included additional tools to aid with accessibility factors such as text-speech, translation and pre-loaded terms and conditions. 

## 🛠 How we built it 
**Frontend:** The frontend of our website was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and Vue. We also used Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Bulma for styling.
**Backend:** The backend of our website was built with Python Flask, Firebase for authentication and SQLite databases.
**Machine Learning:** We used NLTK and HuggingFace to train our Natural Language Processing models.
**Branding, UI, design, and Video:** We designed our website using Figma and edited our demo video using Adobe After Effects.

## 🛑 Challenges we ran into
* The short time frame was a challenge since all of our team members had other commitments over the weekend. As a result, we were unable to spend as much time on the project as we had hoped to.    

* We also were not able to model the “perfect” summarizer, nevertheless, we had tested about a dozen different varieties. So, we had to create a custom solution in this short time frame. 

* Additionally, we had to spend countless hours debugging the front-end framework to get our website up and running.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Creating a custom summarization model in a short time span.
* Designing and prototyping websites in various frameworks while the clock was ticking.

##🧠 What we learned
* Throughout the ups and downs of our journey, we learned that…
* It is important to utilize the team’s strengths when in a time crunch. 
* Time management is key. Having a clear plan on how to distribute tasks from the start helps maximize what we can do in the given time-frame. 
* Begin with a minimum viable product and expand on it.

## 🤔 What's next for Argon
* We plan to create a Chrome extension to allow easier and more efficient access to our service. We also hope to work with professionals in the area...
* Chrome extension; this will be extremely useful as users would not need to copy & paste or upload a file, but could instead let the extension scan the page.
* Working with professionals in the area to make further improvements.
